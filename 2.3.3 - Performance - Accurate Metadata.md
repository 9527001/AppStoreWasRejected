2. 3 Performance: Accurate Metadata
Guideline 2.3.3 - Performance - Accurate Metadata


We noticed that your screenshots do not sufficiently reflect your app in use.

Specifically, your 5.5-inch iPhone￼ screenshots do not display the app in the correct device frame￼.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please revise your screenshots to ensure that they accurately reflect the app in use on the supported devices. For iPhone, you need a set of 5.5-inch display screenshots and for iPad, you need a set for 12.9-inch display. This set will be scaled appropriately down to other device sizes when viewed on the App Store in each territory.

Note that 6.5-inch display assets for iPhone XS Max are optional, and can scale down to iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone X. Screenshots that include features like rounded corners or sensor housing should only be used for the 6.5-inch or 5.8-inch display.

Resources

For resources on creating great screenshots for the App Store, you may want to review the App Store Product Page information available on the Apple developer portal.

Please ensure you have made any screenshot modifications using Media Manager. You should confirm your app looks and behaves identically in all languages and on all supported devices. Learn more about uploading app previews and screenshots in App Store Connect Help.



Please see attached screenshots for details.

Since your App Store Connect status is Metadata Rejected, we do NOT require a new binary. To revise the metadata, visit App Store Connect to select your app and revise the desired metadata values. Once you’ve completed all changes, reply to this message in Resolution Center and we will continue the review.

P:不是屏幕截图的尺寸问题，而是截图中在5.5英寸上不能出现iPhone X的手机模型，手机模型要模糊化
A:更换图片即可
