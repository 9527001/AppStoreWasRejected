Guideline 1.2 - Safety - User Generated Content


Your app enables the display of user-generated content but does not have the proper precautions in place.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please revise your app to implement all of the following precautions:

- Require that users agree to terms (EULA) and these terms must make it clear that there is no tolerance for objectionable content or abusive users
- A method for filtering objectionable content
- A mechanism for users to flag objectionable content
- A mechanism for users to block abusive users
- The developer must act on objectionable content reports within 24 hours by removing the content and ejecting the user who provided the offending content

Guideline 2.2 - Performance - Beta Testing


Your app contains references to test, trial, demo, beta, pre-release or other incomplete content.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please remove all references to "demo," "trial," "beta," or "test" in your app description, app icon, screenshots, previews, release notes, and binary. If you would like to conduct a beta trial for your app, you may wish to review the TestFlight Beta Testing Guide.

Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage


We noticed that your app requests the user’s consent to access their camera￼ but does not clarify the use of this feature in the permission modal alert.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please revise the permission modal alert to specify why the app is requesting access to the user's camera￼.

To help users understand why your app is requesting access to their personal data, all permission request alerts in your app should specify how your app will use the requested feature.

Resources

For additional information and instructions on configuring and presenting an alert, please review the Requesting Permission section of the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and the Information Property List Key Reference. You may also want to review the Technical Q&A QA1937: Resolving the Privacy-Sensitive Data App Rejection page for details on how to provide a usage description for permission request alerts.
